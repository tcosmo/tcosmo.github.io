# Introduction

[TODO: context]

**Weather Forecast.** Let's say I'm giving you the following forecast for tomorrow's weather:

<div class="imgcap">
<div>
<img src="/assets/H/forecast.png" style=" height:400px;">
</div>
<div class="thecap">My weather forecast for tomorrow : very likely to be sunny</div>
</div>
<br/>
That is, it's 99% likely to be sunny and only 1% likely to be rainy.
Well, if tomorrow you wake up and it's **sunny**
